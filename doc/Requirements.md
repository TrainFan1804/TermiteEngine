# In which points should the engine help the developer?

The engine should help the developer to create these games as good as possible. My personal goal is it to create a engine where the developer should just create an instance and create the action in those. Then he must connect the different instances and give it to the engine. The engine should handle the rest. The developer should also not define the *keywords* which the player can use to navigate through the game.

# How can the user interact with the created game?

To simplify the creation step for the developer the engine provide a default set of commands the user can enter in the console to controll the game. The commands are:
`SAVE`      save the game
`LOAD`      load a saved game
`EXIT`      exit the game
`INV`       open the inventory
`MAP`       open the map
`HELP`      open the help menu
`TALK`      talk to the NPC in the instance
`SEARCH`    search for secrets in the instance
`USE`       use something in the instance
`GO`        go to the next instance
`LEAVE`     leave the instance
